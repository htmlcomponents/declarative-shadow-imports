@KurtCattiSchmidt, @dandclark, and Tien Mai have provided an excellent analysis/proposal loosely titled "[Declarative shadow DOM style sharing](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/ShadowDOM/explainer.md)".

Framed as "a starting point for engaging the community and standards bodies in developing collaborative solutions fit for standardization", as I understand it, in my words it envisions:

- a declarative form of ES module imports/exports
- for importing resources (CSS, HTML & other)
- into a declarative shadow DOM
- via the module graph

Many thanks for potentially moving forward multiple issues like #909, #910, #939, #10176 and more.

I have made [some suggestions in this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NdUZro3pvE554e0b62FldwwkeYvzm77TYGp9-bhTBNc/edit?usp=sharing) with examples on [github](https://github.com/htmlcomponents/declarative-shadow-imports).
